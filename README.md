- `index.html` or `*.html` → the HTML file that runs the game.  
- `*.nds` → the Nintendo DS ROM for the game.  
- Make sure the ROM file stays in the same folder as the HTML.

## How to Run Locally

### Option 1: Using Live Server (Recommended)
1. Open the repository folder in **VS Code**.  
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (if not already installed).  
3. Right-click the HTML file for the game (e.g., `pokemonplatinum.html`).  
4. Click **“Open with Live Server”**.  
5. Your browser will open the game. Click the **Fullscreen button** if available.

### Option 2: Opening Directly in Browser
1. Navigate to the folder containing the HTML file.  
2. Double-click the HTML file to open it in your browser.  
⚠️ Some browsers may restrict local file access — Live Server is recommended.

## Notes

- Make sure all files stay in the same folder structure to avoid broken links.  
- The games are fully local; no internet connection is required once the files are downloaded.  
- ROMs (`.nds` files) are required to run the games. Make sure you own them legally.  
- You can play multiple games by opening the corresponding HTML files in their folders.

## Optional: Fullscreen

Some games have a **Fullscreen button** in the top-right corner. Click it to expand the game to your entire browser window.
